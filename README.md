# Study of Generative Machine Learning Methods for Particle Physics
Work presented for the completion of the SPA6776 Extended Independent Project (30-credits) of the BSc in Theoretical Physics at the Queen Mary University of London.

GANNs/VAE for events generation in particle physics. For more detail and the full-text, please refer to dissertation_sergio_calvo.pdf.
  
This is a joint project where:
- Sergio Calvo Ordo√±ez focused on the implementation of the Generative Adversarial Networks and,
- Martin Fanev focused his work on the implementation of the Variational Autoencoder.
